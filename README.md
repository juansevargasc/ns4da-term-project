# Term Project

## Introduction
In this project, we aim to explore and leverage the structural patterns within an Amazon co-purchase network to enhance product recommendations. By applying advanced network algorithms, we seek to understand how the purchase of one product can influence subsequent purchases. This understanding will be harnessed to develop a predictive model capable of recommending the most probable next product to Amazon customers.

## Project Goal
The goal of this project is to use network algorithms to capture the structure of an Amazon co-purchase network, where the purchase of product (i) often leads to the purchase of product (j). By leveraging these algorithms, we aim to train a model that can predict the most probable product to recommend, given a specific product on Amazon. This will enable us to understand and utilize the underlying patterns in the co-purchase network to improve product recommendations.

## Project Scope
The scope of this project includes working with our available Amazon dataset and utilizing the free tier of computation provided by Google Colab. Due to computational constraints, we will work with a sampled version of the full network. Additionally, our recommendation system will be designed to suggest only one product at a time, rather than generating a list of potential product recommendations.
